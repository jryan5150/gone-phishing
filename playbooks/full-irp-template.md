## Why You Need an Incident Response Plan

Cybersecurity incidents are not a matter of *if* but *when*. An incident response plan is essential because:

1. **Regulatory compliance** — Required by CMMC, HIPAA, PCI DSS, NIST 800-171, SOX, and many other frameworks
2. **Reduced impact** — Organizations with tested IR plans contain breaches significantly faster and at lower cost
3. **Legal protection** — Demonstrates due diligence and can reduce liability
4. **Insurance requirements** — Most cyber insurance policies require a documented IR plan
5. **Business continuity** — Enables faster recovery and reduces operational downtime
6. **Stakeholder confidence** — Shows customers, partners, and regulators that you take security seriously

### The Cost of Not Having a Plan

According to industry breach cost research, organizations without an incident response team and tested IR plan experience significantly higher costs and longer breach lifecycles compared to those with mature IR capabilities.

## Incident Response Frameworks

This template is based on the **NIST SP 800-61 Rev. 2** framework, which defines six phases of incident response (PICERL):

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **P**reparation | Build IR capability before an incident occurs |
| **I**dentification | Detect and confirm that an incident has occurred |
| **C**ontainment | Limit the damage and prevent further spread |
| **E**radication | Remove the threat from the environment |
| **R**ecovery | Restore systems to normal operations |
| **L**essons Learned | Document what happened and improve for next time |

This is also compatible with SANS incident response methodology and can be adapted for ISO 27035 or CISA incident response guidance.

## Incident Response Playbooks

### Ransomware Response Playbook

**Trigger**: Ransomware detected or suspected on any system.

**Immediate Actions (First 15 Minutes)**:
1. **DO NOT** pay the ransom without executive and legal approval
2. **DO NOT** power off affected systems (preserve evidence in memory)
3. Disconnect affected systems from the network (pull ethernet, disable WiFi)
4. Alert the IR Lead and initiate S1 response
5. Activate out-of-band communication (personal phones, separate email)
6. Take photos of any ransom notes displayed on screens

**Containment (First Hour)**:
1. Identify the scope — how many systems are affected?
2. Determine the ransomware variant (ransom note, file extension, IOCs)
3. Check for available decryptors at [No More Ransom Project](https://www.nomoreransom.org/)
4. Block known C2 (command and control) domains and IPs at the firewall
5. Disable file sharing services (SMB, NFS)
6. Isolate network segments containing affected systems
7. Preserve at least one encrypted system for forensic analysis

**Assessment**:
1. Determine the entry point (phishing, RDP, vulnerability, supply chain)
2. Assess data exfiltration — check for double extortion indicators
3. Evaluate backup integrity — are backups intact and uncompromised?
4. Notify cyber insurance carrier
5. Engage forensics firm if needed

**Recovery**:
1. Rebuild affected systems from clean images
2. Restore data from verified clean backups
3. Reset all credentials (domain admin, service accounts, user accounts)
4. Apply patches that address the entry point vulnerability
5. Implement enhanced monitoring before reconnecting systems
6. Monitor for re-infection for 90 days

### Phishing Incident Playbook

**Trigger**: Employee reports a suspicious email or clicks a suspected phishing link.

**If the user only received/reported (did not click)**:
1. Thank the user for reporting
2. Analyze the email headers, links, and attachments in a sandbox
3. Block the sender domain/IP at the email gateway
4. Search for the same email across all mailboxes
5. Remove all instances of the phishing email
6. Update email filtering rules

**If the user clicked a link or opened an attachment**:
1. Immediately isolate the user's workstation from the network
2. Have the user change their password from a different, clean device
3. Check for credential harvesting — was a login page spoofed?
4. If credentials were entered: force password reset, revoke active sessions, check for MFA bypass
5. Run full endpoint scan on affected workstation
6. Check email rules for unauthorized forwarding rules
7. Review audit logs for the compromised account

4. Check network logs for data exfiltration indicators
5. Assess whether data was actually viewed or just accessible

**Notification** (per legal guidance):
1. Prepare notification letters for affected individuals
2. File required regulatory notifications
3. Establish a call center or FAQ page if large-scale breach
4. Offer credit monitoring if PII was exposed

### Business Email Compromise (BEC) Playbook

**Trigger**: Email account takeover, fraudulent wire transfer request, or vendor impersonation detected.

**Immediate Actions**:
1. If a wire transfer was initiated: contact the bank immediately to halt/reverse the transfer

2. Review email access logs for unauthorized access from unusual IPs/locations
3. Check for OAuth app consent grants
4. Identify all contacts who received fraudulent emails
5. Assess financial impact

**Recovery**:

## Tabletop Exercise Scenarios

Use these scenarios for annual tabletop exercises to test your IR plan:

### Scenario 1: Ransomware Attack
> On a Monday morning, multiple employees report that their files have been encrypted and a ransom note demands $500,000 in Bitcoin. IT discovers that the file server, domain controller, and 40% of workstations are affected. The attacker claims to have exfiltrated customer data and threatens to publish it.

**Discussion Questions**:
- Who do we notify first?
- Do we have clean backups? How quickly can we restore?
- How do we determine if data was actually exfiltrated?
- What is our position on ransom payment?
- What are our notification obligations?

### Scenario 2: Insider Data Theft
> HR notifies you that a senior engineer submitted their resignation. The next day, the SIEM alerts that the engineer copied 50GB of files to a personal cloud storage account, including source code and customer databases, outside of normal working hours.

### Scenario 3: Supply Chain Compromise
> A critical software vendor announces that their update server was compromised and a malicious update was distributed to all customers over the past 30 days. Your organization deployed this update to all servers two weeks ago.

### Scenario 4: Business Email Compromise
> The CFO receives an urgent email from the CEO (who is traveling abroad) requesting an immediate wire transfer of $250,000 to a new vendor. The finance team processes the transfer. Two hours later, the real CEO calls in and denies sending the email.

## ⚠️ An Untested Plan Is Not a Plan

Having a document on a shelf doesn't mean your organization can execute under pressure. **The majority of organizations that suffer a breach discover gaps in their IR plan during the incident itself** — when it's too late to fix them.

- **No one knows their role** — The plan names a team, but those people have never practiced their responsibilities
- **Communication plans fail** — Contact lists are outdated, notification templates don't exist, legal counsel isn't pre-engaged
- **Containment decisions take too long** — Without pre-authorized actions, every step requires executive approval while the attacker moves laterally
- **Evidence is destroyed** — Well-meaning IT staff reimage systems before forensic collection, eliminating the ability to determine scope

> **Organizations with a tested IR plan contain breaches 54% faster and save an average of $1.49M per incident** (IBM Cost of a Data Breach Report).
